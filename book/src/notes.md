# Note

A **note** is an immutable object that represents a unit of value. Each note belongs to a certain application (which defines the note's type), and can store some data:

``` rust
pub struct Note {
pub value_base: NoteType,
pub app_data_dynamic: pallas::Base,
/// value denotes the amount of the note.
pub value: u64,
/// the nullifier key commitment Whoever has nk, can spend the note (more or less).
pub nk_com: NullifierKeyCom,
pub is_merkle_checked: bool,
...
}
```

#### Sending notes

As the notes are immutable, sending a note (transfering the ownership) means **destroying** the existing note (spent note) and **creating** a new note (output note) with a different owner.

`Note(owner: A, application: T, value: V) -> Note(owner: B, application: T, value: V)`

To send a note, the owner needs to prove the ownership which is done by revealing note's nullifier `nf`.  The nullifier is only known to the owner of the note and revealing it destroys the note. All revealed nullifiers are stored in a public nullifier tree `NFtree` to make sure none of the notes are spent twice.

##### Proving ownership in ZK
All of the notes are kept shielded and created notes are sent to users in an encrypted form. To keep the notes shielded, ZK proofs are used. Using ZK proof, one can prove the ownership without revealing the note itself (see [Action circuit](action.md)).

#### The commitment tree

Each created note exists in a public merkle tree `CMtree` of notes. To keep the notes shielded, the tree contains note commitments `cm` instead of the notes themselves. This tree is called a note commitment tree.

#### Note structure
The full description of the note structure is

```rust
pub struct Note<CP: CircuitParameters> {
	pub owner: User<CP>,
	pub app: App<CP>,
	pub value: u64,
	pub data: CP::CurveScalarField,
	pub rho: Nullifier<CP>,
	pub psi: CP::CurveScalarField,
	pub rcm: CP::CurveScalarField,
}
```

, where:
- `data` is additional information that might be useful to describe notes of a certain type (e.g. NFTs)
- `rho`  and `psi` are the values used to compute the note's nullifier
- `rcm` is randomness used to compute the commitment `cm`

#### Dummy notes
Dummy notes might be useful to keep the amount of notes constant and hide the actual amount of notes in a tx.
