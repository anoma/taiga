# Conclusion

We need to talk about what is still not possible: blake2 circuit, full blinding because of Ïƒ polynomials, accumulation for efficiency (and/or change of proof system?).
* What we are able to do
* What we don't have yet: blake2 circuit, hash to BaseField, etc.

## Performance
The performance is significantly affected by the proof generation, i.e. the number of proofs and the circuit size of the proof.

In a transaction, the `Action circuit` and `Blind VP circuit` are fixed. The VP circuit size is decided by the number of notes and the custom constraint. The number of proofs are decided by the number of notes. Therefore, we tested the tx performance with different numbers of notes.

### Performance of Action Proof and Blind VP Proof
The performance of `Action Proof` and `Blind VP Proof` are independent from the number of notes.

### Potential Performance Improvement
* Proofs generation parallelization
* Circuit improvement, e.g. basic gadgets improvement, local data refinement, etc
* Proof system improvement, e.g. change to Halo2, use accumulation or aggregation.


# TODO Lists
* An implementation of Blake2 gadget for vp commitment in vp circuit and blind vp circuit [#56](https://github.com/anoma/taiga/issues/56). Now we had a dusk/plonk implementation version from Joshua, and we need to adapt it to zk-garage/plonkup.
* A poseidon implementation for `MainCurve::BaseField`. We had an implementation for MainCurve::ScalarField, and we need to fix the parameters generation for  `MainCurve::BaseField`.
* A verifiable encryption circuit [#7](https://github.com/anoma/taiga/issues/7).
* More useful vp examples [#5](https://github.com/anoma/taiga/issues/5)
* Define the `vp_param` and `vp_memo` in vp.
* Ledger integrity [#6](https://github.com/anoma/taiga/issues/6), e.g. CommitmentTree implementation, interface with ledger etc.
* Fix partially blinding vp.
* Switch to halo2 proof system.
