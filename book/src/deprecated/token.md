# Token application

Applications that implement a cryptoasset may be the simplest example of an application. 
A basic validity predicate of a token application would just make sure that the balance is preserved, 
but more complex versions can have additional constraints.

A token application might allow its users to have userVPs so that the users can express their preferences.
