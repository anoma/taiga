# Taiga overview

## Motivation

The purpose of Taiga is to enable fully programmable private decentralised applications. Prior work such as [Zexe](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/962.pdf) and [VeriZexe](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/802) have one major limitation: the counter-party in a transaction must be known, which limits the types of applications one can create on these systems. Taiga provides a mechanism for counter-party discovery and settlement, and allows parties to express their intents in a declarative way. This intent-gossip architecture enables the creation of many private applications that we already encounter in web2 but can't still exist in web3 with the current systems.
